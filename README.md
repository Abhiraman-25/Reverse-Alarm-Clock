# Reverse Alarm Clock üåô

## Basic Details
### Team Name: ERROR

### Team Members
- Team Lead: A. Abhiraman - Adi Shankara Engineering Colledge
- Member 2: Aleena Ann Jacob - Adi Shankara Engineering Colledge

### Project Description
A web application that randomly wakes you up at night with annoying sounds to remind you to go back to sleep. Because who needs uninterrupted sleep anyway?

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are sleeping too peacefully through the night and need to be reminded that they should be sleeping. Normal alarm clocks only wake you up in the morning, but what about those crucial 3 AM wake-up calls?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A reverse alarm clock that uses the Web Audio API to generate various annoying sounds (including nostalgic dial-up modem noises) and randomly triggers during your specified "active hours" to disrupt your sleep cycle and remind you to go back to sleep.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Web Audio API for sound generation
- Service Workers for background operation
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- LocalStorage for settings persistence
- Notification API for desktop alerts

For Hardware:
- Any modern web browser
- Speakers/headphones for maximum annoyance
- Internet connection (optional - works offline)

### Implementation
For Software:

# Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]

# Navigate to project directory
cd ALARM

# No build process required - pure web technologies!
```

# Run
```bash
# Start local server
python -m http.server 8000

# Open in browser
http://localhost:8000
```

### Project Documentation
